      <h2>Duplication of Euler model</h2>
      <!-- <ol>
      <li>Comprehension du code</li>
      <li>Copie de Euler</li>
      </ol> -->



      <p>In the SU2 code, a solver has been added for impact equation.
      This solver use the air solution generated with the Euler solver.
      Impact equations are similar to the Euler equations, so the impact solver is based on the Euler solver.
      At the beginning we have search how is build the Euler solver to duplicate this solver and create the impact solver.
      The duplication of the solver has added 20.000 lines in the SU2 code.
      </p>

      <h2>Cleaning</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the cleaning is to reduce the number of lines in the Impact solver. The main file of this solver is solver_direct_impact.cpp. The cleaning ease the work in this file.
        For each function,if the function is not necessary, the function is removed in the files solver_direct_impact.cpp and solver_structure.h. Else unnecessary part, like viscous part or lift coefficient, are removed.
        We have verified that the results in a test case doesn't change.
        32 function have been removed, it reduced the number of lines in solver_direct_impact.cpp by 9,000.
      </p>


      <h2>Output</h2>
      <p>
        There are two output formats in SU2 CFD for visualisation which are Paraview and Tecplot. Paraview is great for 2D or 3D postprocessing. Tecplot is useful for plotting graphs of 1D cuts in python.
        The output variables have been changed for the impact equations. We have removed unnecessary variables in impact output files like pressure, pressure coefficient or Mach number.
        We have added impact variables in both conservative and non-conservative forms to ease postprocessing.
        We have computed and export the collection efficiency which characterise the ability of the airfoil to capture water. This is a common way in the literature to compare droplet impingement rates.
      </p>

      <h2>Source Term </h2> <!-- (<a href="ts.html">details</a>) -->
      <p>
        As said before, the Euler problem was duplicated but for the Impact, the <a href="problem.html" class="text">system</a> to resolve is different.
        Indeed, in comparison with the Euler problem, there is no pressure term and there are two terms to add : the drag and the gravity terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, the gravity term was already implemented in SU2, so it should be added for the Impact model in the same way than in the other model where it is used.
        But for the drag term, it was added exclusively for the Impact problem. In order to know how to add them,
        we rewrote the problem in a conservative way with F the flow and Q the source term.
      </p>
      <a href="../Images/ConsEq.png"><img src="../Images/ConsEq_mini.png" alt="Conservative Equation" title="Conservative Equation" /></a>
      <p>
        Then, knowing that the numerical scheme used to solve this equation is a Roe scheme with implicit Euler, the source term needed to be added properly in the Jacobian of the system.
        This Jacobian is described below, where the Jacobian of R is the Jacobian of the let part of the previous equation, already computed in the Euler model, and the Jacobian of Q is the jacobian of the source term.
        Hence, the Jacobian of Q was calculated and added to the global Jacobian of the system.
      </p>
      <a href="../Images/Jac.png"><img src="../Images/Jac.png" alt="Jacobian of R" title="J_R" /></a>
      <p>
        After added this two terms, the pressure term had to be removed. However, according to several publications, the removal of the pressure term leads to some numerical problems and even more to a solution that diverges.
        So, a work was needed to stabilize the system, and that was done by our supervisors.
      </p>

      <h2>Boundary Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        A new type of boundary conditions for the Impact model was added, named IMPACT WALL and discrebed below.
      </p>
      <a href="../Images/BCeq.png"><img src="../Images/BCeq.png" alt="Boundary Conditions" title="Boundary Conditions" /></a>
      <p>
        The idea is that : if the speed of the flow penetrates the boundary, we set the velocity normal component  and the coefficient alpha at 0
        and if the speed of flow emerges from the boundary, the velocity is not changed. Simultaneously, a new variable  define on this IMPACT WALL boundary  where the impinging mass is calculated.
